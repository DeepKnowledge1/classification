the major components in your Azure ML project structure

# Azure Machine Learning Components Overview

## Resource Group
The foundation of Azure resource organization. Resource groups act as logical containers that hold related resources for an Azure solution.
They enable you to manage and organize your Azure ML resources efficiently, apply permissions across multiple resources,
 and handle lifecycle management.

## Workspace
Azure ML workspace is your main working environment in the cloud. It's the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning,
providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create. The workspace keeps track of all training runs,
deployments, metrics, and more.

## Storage Account
Azure Storage accounts are essential for Azure ML operations. They provide secure, scalable cloud storage for various data
types including datasets, model files, and logs. The storage account is automatically linked to your workspace and serves
 as the default storage for training data and model artifacts.

## Compute Cluster
A compute cluster is a managed compute infrastructure that allows you to easily create a single or multi-node compute.
 The cluster scales up and down automatically when submitting a job, making it ideal for batch training and parallel
 processing of large datasets.

## Compute Instance
A compute instance is a fully managed cloud workstation optimized for your machine learning development environment.
It provides a Jupyter notebook server, VS Code integration, and other development tools pre-configured for ML work.


## Container
Containers in Azure ML provide isolated, consistent environments for training and deployment.
They package code and dependencies together, ensuring reproducibility across different environments and making it easier to deploy models as web services.

## Data Assets
Data assets provide a way to store and version your data in Azure ML. They abstract the underlying
storage details and provide a consistent interface to access data, whether it's files, tables, or other formats,
making data management and sharing easier.

## Datastore
Datastores are abstractions for cloud storage. They encapsulate the information required to connect to data sources
like Azure Storage, Azure Data Lake, or Azure SQL Database. Datastores provide credential-free access to your data in training scripts.

## Job Training
Job training components handle the execution of ML training workflows. They manage the logistics of running training
 scripts on compute targets, handling data input/output, and tracking metrics and artifacts.

## Model Deployment
The deployment components include:
- Endpoints: Entry points for real-time inference
- Deployment configurations: Settings for model serving
- Scoring scripts: Code that defines how your model processes requests

## Integration
Integration components help connect Azure ML with your development workflow:
- Conda environments for dependency management
- Testing frameworks for CI/CD pipelines
- Requirements specification for reproducible environments
