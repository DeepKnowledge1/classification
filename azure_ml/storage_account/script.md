# Azure Storage Account Creation with Python SDK - YouTube Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)
"Hey there, developers! Today we're diving into something really practical - creating an Azure Storage Account using Python. We'll be using the Azure SDK to automate this process, which is super helpful when you're working on larger projects or need to set up resources programmatically. Let's get started!"

## Prerequisites (45 seconds)
"Before we jump in, make sure you have:
- An Azure subscription
- Python installed on your machine
- The Azure SDK packages installed
- Azure CLI configured with your credentials

I'll put all these requirements in the video description below."

## Code Walkthrough (5 minutes)

### Part 1: Authentication and Setup (1 minute)
"First, let's look at how we authenticate with Azure. We're using DefaultAzureCredential, which is really flexible - it tries different authentication methods automatically:

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
storage_client = StorageManagementClient(credential, subscription_id)
```

This is great because it works both locally and in production environments."

### Part 2: Storage Account Parameters (1 minute)
"Now, let's break down the storage account configuration:
```python
storage_account_params = {
    "sku": {"name": "Standard_LRS"},
    "kind": "BlobStorage",
    "location": region,
    "tags": {"environment": "demo", "project": "azure-ml"}
}
```
We're setting up a standard locally redundant storage account. The tags are optional but super helpful for organization and cost tracking."

### Part 3: Creating the Storage Account (1 minute)
"The actual creation is handled by this method:
```python
storage_client.storage_accounts.begin_create(
    resource_group_name=resource_group,
    account_name=storage_account_name,
    parameters=storage_account_params
).result()
```
Notice we're using begin_create() which returns a poller - this handles the async nature of resource creation in Azure."

### Part 4: Blob Service Connection (1 minute)
"Once our storage account is created, we can connect to the blob service:
```python
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(
    account_url=f"https://{storage_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/",
    credential=credential
)
```
This gives us access to create containers and manage blobs."

### Part 5: Command Line Interface (1 minute)
"We've wrapped everything in a CLI using argparse, making it super easy to use:
```python
python az_storage_account.py \
  --subscription_id "your-subscription-id" \
  --resource_group "your-resource-group" \
  --storage_account_name "your-storage-name" \
  --region "eastus"
```"

## Demo (2 minutes)
"Let's see this in action! I'll run the script and create a storage account...
[Show terminal executing the command and the Azure portal showing the new storage account]"

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
"And there you have it! You've just learned how to programmatically create an Azure Storage Account using Python. This is just scratching the surface of what you can do with the Azure SDK.
